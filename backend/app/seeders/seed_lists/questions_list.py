# Python List Operations with More Complex Code (Part 2)

I'm continuing my learning about Python lists and how to manipulate them in different ways. I have another set of tasks for list operations, this time working with a list of lists.

## Question:

I have the following list of lists, where each sublist contains the scores of different students across three subjects:

```python
scores = [
    [85, 92, 78],  # Alice's scores
    [88, 79, 94],  # Bob's scores
    [91, 85, 82],  # Charlie's scores
    [78, 88, 90],  # David's scores
    [95, 97, 89]   # Eva's scores
]
```

1. How can I access the score of Alice in the second subject (index 1)?
2. Write a Python code snippet to calculate the total score for each student (sum of their three subject scores).
3. Write a function that takes the list `scores` and returns a new list where each element is the average score of each student.
4. How can I update Bob's score in the third subject (index 2) to 98?
5. Write a code to find the highest total score among all students and print the name of the student with the highest score.
6. How can I append a new student "Frank" with scores `[90, 88, 95]` to the `scores` list?

Thank you for your help!

# Python List Operations with More Complex Code

I'm a beginner in Python, and I'm learning how to perform various operations on lists. I have a more complicated scenario now and have a few questions regarding list manipulations.

## Question:

I have the following list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a student with their name and grade:

```python
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "grade": 85},
    {"name": "Bob", "grade": 92},
    {"name": "Charlie", "grade": 78},
    {"name": "David", "grade": 91},
    {"name": "Eva", "grade": 88}
]
```

1. How can I access the name of the third student in the list `students`?
2. Write a Python code snippet to get the average grade of all students in the list.
3. How can I add a new student, "Frank", with a grade of 95 to the list?
4. Write a code to remove the student "Charlie" from the list based on their name.
5. How can I sort the list `students` by grade, in descending order?

# Python String Operators Question

I'm a beginner in Python, and I'm learning about string operators. I have a few questions about how they work.

## Question:

I have the following string:

```python
text = "Hello, World!"
```

1. How can I access the character at index 7 in the string `text`?
2. What does the `+` operator do when used with strings? Can you give me an example of how to use it?
3. I know that strings are immutable, but is there a way to change part of the string using an operator? If not, what can I do if I want to modify a string?

# JavaScript Array Operations

I'm a beginner in JavaScript and I'm learning how to work with arrays. I have a few questions regarding array operations and manipulations.

## Question:

I have the following array of objects, where each object represents a book with its title, author, and year of publication:

```javascript
const books = [
    { title: "To Kill a Mockingbird", author: "Harper Lee", year: 1960 },
    { title: "1984", author: "George Orwell", year: 1949 },
    { title: "The Great Gatsby", author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald", year: 1925 },
    { title: "Moby-Dick", author: "Herman Melville", year: 1851 },
    { title: "War and Peace", author: "Leo Tolstoy", year: 1869 }
];
```

1. How can I access the title of the third book in the `books` array?
2. Write a JavaScript function that takes the array `books` and returns the titles of all books published after 1900.
3. How can I add a new book `{ title: "Pride and Prejudice", author: "Jane Austen", year: 1813 }` to the `books` array?
4. How can I remove the book "Moby-Dick" from the array by title?
5. Write a function that sorts the books by their year of publication in ascending order.
6. How can I check if the book "1984" exists in the array by its title?
