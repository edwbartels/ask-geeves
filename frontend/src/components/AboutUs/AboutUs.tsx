                    At Ask Geeves, our mission is to create a collaborative 
                    space where curious minds can ask questions, share knowledge, 
                    and empower each other through thoughtful, insightful answers. 
                    We believe in the power of community-driven learning, where 
                    every question is valued, every answer is an opportunity to 
                    teach, and every user contributes to building a smarter, more 
                    informed world.
